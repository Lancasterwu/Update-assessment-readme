# cs203-S2019-assessment

This repository contains the assessment sheet for [Computer Science 203 Spring
2019](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/). The instructor
will add this assessment sheet to a new GitHub Classroom repository each when
the software engineering team is completing an assignment. The instructor
invites each student in the course to master the technical and professional
skills listed on this assignment sheet.

## Improving the Assessment

The students from [Computer Science 203 Spring
2019](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/teaching/cs203S2019/) used [GitHub flow
model](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) to collaboratively improve
the assessment sheet. Students finalized the list of technical and
professional skills on which they want to be assessed during the Spring 2019
semester. They also described the student behaviors that would lead to an
assessment at one of the following levels:

* N = None
* I = Inadequate
* A = Adequate
* G = Good
* E = Excellent

Finally, you should explain how the assessment for each of the technical and
professional skills will result in an overall assessment for a software project.
(need more explainations here)
Once you are finished with the assessment, please update the README as
necessary.(Will delete this line after we finished updating)

## How we design Assessment Sheet

We divided the whole group into some small teams. Each team is handling some specific
topics. We created forks by teams based on this main repository. Team members of
each team created pull requests to edit the part they were assigned to do. We
then merged team forks to a main for to make sure we all have the same format.
After that, we are safe tomerge everything into the main repository.

The Professional Skills part of the Assessment Sheet is done by Team Spencer:

```
Lancasterwu - Interactions with the course instructor and Interactions with the
Teaching assistant
mmarconi - Attendance, Deadlines, Communication, Participation
libailong - Conduct, Decisions, Postmortems, Conflicts, Infractions
huangs1 - Interactions with the customer and interactions with the team leaders
```

This group of students finished Groups and Interactions of Professional Skills

```

ALEXANDERB82
leonardoz15
reibelj - Understanding and adopting best practices, Assisting with Project management 
with GitHub, specifically the Flow Model and Python Development
```

This group of students handled commits a little differently. They created a single
fork for their row and everyone commited their work to said fork. Regarless of the
differences, they were responsible for the Individual and Revision of Guides section of
Professional Skills.

The Foundations of Software Engineering Section was Completed by:

```
szklenskij (Jared Szlenski)
thomad74 (Dillon Thoma)
wattob (Benjamin Watto)
```
Project Management With GitHub and Continuous Integration With Travis CI by:
```
finneyj2 (Jahlia Finney)
Alex-Yarkosky (Alex Yarkosky)
livingstonp229 (Paul Livingston)
ohnoanarrow (Tara Douglass)
```
(We need other teams)

## Challenges When Making Assessment Sheet

When making the Assessment Sheet, we started out rather disorganized and in 
a number of different groups all of whom were mostly communicating with just
each other. As such, we encountered the issue of having differing style 
guides and needed to coordinate over Slack and make some extra commits over
GitHub in order to make a unified style and make sure that each of our 
portions fit that style guide. 

We also encountered a number of obstacles in applying the grading skill to 
some technical and personal skills, chiefly that some of the levels didn't 
seem to apply to all of the skills. This and other factors, made it 
difficult to outline the specific diferences between some levels of the 
grading scale(example: the difference between inadequate and good).
"None" in particular was difficult at times to distinguish from 
"Inadequate" in some cases. But we managed to circumvent these issues 
with communication among personal teams and the larger group.
